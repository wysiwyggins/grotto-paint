# Grotto Paint

This started as a tile-painting program for making art for the game [Grotto](https://grotto.wileywiggins.com)

As more features were needed, I switched to [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) to do most woork, but still use this to do light/dark analysis for rotoscoping animations to export in tiled format and finish there. I'd like to try adding new features to this tool, like cellular automata.
